# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart:  failing to properly handle exceptions in asynchronous operations using `Future` and `async`/`await`. The `fetchData` function fetches data from an API, but the error handling is incomplete. 

The initial `bug.dart` file shows the problem, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version with improved exception handling.
